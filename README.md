# OSGi-Based Emergency Healthcare System

## Introduction

The **OSGi-Based Emergency Healthcare System** is an advanced healthcare solution designed to facilitate real-time patient monitoring, emergency response coordination, and hospital management. Leveraging the modular and dynamic capabilities of the **OSGi framework**, this system enables seamless interaction between diverse healthcare services.

In this architecture, **publishers** generate critical health data, while **consumers** process and act upon it. The system ensures efficient communication among patients, doctors, hospitals, and ambulances, significantly reducing emergency response times and improving patient outcomes through automated alerts and data-driven decision-making.
